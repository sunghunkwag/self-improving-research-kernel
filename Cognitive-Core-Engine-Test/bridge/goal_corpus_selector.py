"""DEPRECATED: replaced by ``bridges/goal_synthesis_bridge.py`` (PLAN.md Phase 4).

This module owns its own ``hdc_core.FhrrArena`` instance, which violates
PLAN.md Rule 3 (single arena owner) and is the orphaned third arena
identified in PLAN.md Section A. It is preserved unchanged for any
downstream code that still imports it; new callers should migrate to
:class:`bridges.goal_synthesis_bridge.GoalSynthesisBridge`.
