"""
Axiomatic Synthesizer — Deterministic phase-transition engine that accumulates
'Axiom Vectors' from stable codebases and synthesizes novel structural
hypervectors through mathematically provable binding operations.

No randomness. No LLMs. Every operation is a deterministic function of the
input corpus and the VSA algebra (FHRR bind/bundle/correlate).

Singularity Expansion:
  - Autopoietic Self-Reference (Ouroboros Loop): recursively ingests its own
    source code, projects it through the pipeline, and synthesizes self-representations.
    Z3 proves whether newly synthesized self-representations are strictly more
    optimal (lower thermodynamic entropy).
  - Meta-Grammar Emergence: delegates to ConstraintDecoder for UNSAT-triggered
    dimension expansion and operator fusion.
  - Topological Thermodynamics: entropy-aware synthesis selects minimum-complexity
    phase transitions.

Mathematical foundation:
  - Each stable codebase c_i is projected to an axiom vector A_i ∈ S^{d-1} (unit torus).
  - Structural resonance between axioms: ρ(A_i, A_j) = correlate(A_i, A_j).
  - Per-layer synthesis preserves layer decomposition:
      S_ast  = A₁_ast  ⊗ A₂_ast  ⊗ ... ⊗ Aₖ_ast
      S_cfg  = A₁_cfg  ⊗ A₂_cfg  ⊗ ... ⊗ Aₖ_cfg
      S_data = A₁_data ⊗ A₂_data ⊗ ... ⊗ Aₖ_data
      S_final = S_ast ⊗ S_cfg ⊗ S_data
